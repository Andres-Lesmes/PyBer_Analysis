# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
  In this analysis we are working on a set of data obtained from a python based share ride app PyBer. The objective is to allocate the differences between the city types and how to allocate the services better in order to offer a better service.

## Results
  We found that the urban cities have more rides and drivers. However, the average fare per ride is lower. Also, rural cities have less rides and drivers but the average fare per ride is higher. Moreover, the total fare is higher in urban cities and lower in rural cities.

## Summary
  In order to level out the outcome on the city types we recommend to increase the amount of drivers in rural cities. Also, if we reduce the amount of drivers in urban cities. The average fare per city type in urban areas could increase. Also, we recommend to check the fares in rural cities since the standard deviation is high compared to the other city types.
